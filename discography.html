		<h2>About - Discography</h2>
		<h4>"Step Out! We are Stray Kids"</h4>
		<p>Anneyong! This is Jasmine Andrei Flores, a 15-year old lost and uninspired student who is at the verge of failing her Computer Subject for not being able to pass her website on time. To cut it short, my website mainly talks about a kpop boy group namely, Stray Kids, and their music. And as a Kpop enthusiast and also someone who advocates social awareness, I chose Stray Kids to represent what I am thinking. I chose them to be the topic for website because their music mainly talks about social issues -  identity crisis and such. Also, whenever someone would say 'Kpop', the only thing that would come into their mind is 'BTS', and I want to change that. Kpop isn't only about BTS, there are a lot of groups worth stanning over. One for example is Stray Kids.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Q: What is my favorite song in their tracks?</h3>
		<p id="text">A: Well, you can't just choose one especially when all of the choices are worth choosing so,</p>
			<p id="t2">For their "Mixtape", my favorite is "Hellevator", because in this song they talked about their hardships as a idol trainee and how they've overcome it. Also, it talked about how they were in hell (their experiences and challenges as a trainee) and how they've stumbled into an elevator which took them to where they are now (which is performing and making their stage/music).</p>
			<p id="t2">For their "I Am: Not!" Album, their song "Mirror" is my favorite, because there are times whenever I feel lost and not me. It's like I am looking at a mirror and the reflection isn't just me. I kept on questioning who am I, and what am I doing.</p>
			<p id="t2">For their "I Am: Who?" Album, I could say that this album is my favorite of all their albums, not only I had one favorite song in it but all of the tracks were superb. My most favorite song in this album is "Voices", because I can really relate to it. The message is that, whenever we are confused of our surroundings because of the things people are telling us, we just have to stop listening to them. Especially, when those things/words that are being thrown at us are not really good, we just have to tune them down, and pause for awhile. We have to break free from all those voices, just as what the lyrics told us.</p>
			<p id="t2">For their "I Am: You." Album, "My Side" is my favorite because I can personally relate to it. Even though I'm at the age of 15, I'm still afraid of being left alone that's why this song had me. This song merely talks about a person whom will stay by your side. That despite all the problems and challenges that may block the path, that person will still stay by your side. And the reason why I liked this song is because if I had the chance to find that particular person, I wouldn't want them to leave me.</p>
			<p id="t2">For their "Clé 1: Miroh" Album, their track "19" is what I can say my favorite. It is because they have talked about the hardships and the reconsidering decisions of a 19 year old person who is only months/days/weeks away from turning 20. The message had me hooked because not only this 'feeling' occurs on 19 years old's, but also to those persons who are wary of the things they might leave behind and cannot afford to move forward. Fun fact: it was Han Jisung whom composed the entire song. </p>
