		<h2>About - Home</h2>
		<h4>"Step Out! We are Stray Kids"</h4>
		<p>Anneyong! This is Jasmine Andrei Flores, a 15-year old lost and uninspired student who is at the verge of failing her Computer Subject for not being able to pass her website on time. To cut it short, my website mainly talks about a kpop boy group namely, Stray Kids, and their music. And as a Kpop enthusiast and also someone who advocates social awareness, I chose Stray Kids to represent what I am thinking. I chose them to be the topic for website because their music mainly talks about social issues -  identity crisis and such. Also, whenever someone would say 'Kpop', the only thing that would come into their mind is 'BTS', and I want to change that. Kpop isn't only about BTS, there are a lot of groups worth stanning over. One for example is Stray Kids.</p>

		<h3>Q: How did I exactly met Stray Kids?</h3>
		<p id="text">A: Well, Spotify just happened to be shuffling songs in my Daily Mix when it played one of their songs which is 'District 9', and it has this lyric that got stuck in my head. </p>
